##Observers

Observers pull in data from RAM, organize it, and make it available to other parts of Piglet's brain.  Far from being passive, observers actively filter through data to decide which is important enough to look at.  In the same way that your brain decides that some information is irrelivent, or that it needs to be watched, an observer provides more intelligent and efficient memory management.

At the moment, Observers are not going to be abstracted away from Visual Boy advance, which is what Piglet relies on.  Ideally, in the future they would be.
